# Liri 

In this project, I built a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, called Liri.

Liri is meant to be run in the terminal, using Node.js. Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment, that allows to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser. Several node packages have to be installed for Liri to run properly. They are listed in "liri.js", along with guidelines for the installation.

So far, Liri proposes 5 options to the user:
- concert-this
- spotify-this-song
- movie-this
- do-what-it-says
- Nothing, thank you!

**concert-this**<br>
After 

**spotify-this-song**<br>
**movie-this**<br>
**do-what-it-says**<br>
**Nothing, thank you!**<br>
